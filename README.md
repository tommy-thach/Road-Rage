# Road-Rage
This is a little game I made in my high school AP Computer Science class for a fundraiser called "Arcading for Autism".  
The game is made in Java using Greenfoot.
# Controls
Up/Down/Left/Right - Movement keys  

The goal is to survive for as long as you can while collecting coins and using powerups to help you along your way. The difficulty increases as the game goes on.
